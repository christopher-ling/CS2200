Question 1
--------------------------

lea     $ra, return_address  ! Compute the return address and store it in $ra
addi    $ra, $ra, 4          ! Adjust the return address to point to the next instruction
jalr    $at, $zero           ! Jump to the address in $at, save return address in $ra

return_address:
    ! Continue execution here after the jump

This sequence emulates the jalr instruction by first computing the return address using the LEA instruction, which calculates the address of the return_address label and stores it in $ra. The ADDI instruction then adjusts this address by adding 4 to point to the next instruction, as each instruction in the LC-3200 ISA is 4 bytes long. Finally, the JALR instruction jumps to the target address stored in $at while saving the adjusted return address in $ra. This combination of instructions effectively replicates the behavior of jalr, allowing the program to jump to a target address and return to the correct location afterward.
